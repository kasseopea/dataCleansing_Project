The code in this run_analysis.R aims to accomplish each step stated below:
 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Source of data came from :

After running the file run_analysis.R the file will produce two files for item 2 (Project_q2.txt) and item 5(Project_q5.txt).
To run the source code please ensure all data file from Dataset.zip is extracted in the same folder.
